When you take this archetype, you gain psionic spells that cost Focus Points to cast. Additionally, you can use your Focus Points to boost or modify your psionic spells by applying amps. Each of your spells has a special amp heading. Whenever you cast a psionic spell, you can amp it by spending 1 Focus Point to add the amp effect. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to meditate or perform a physical regimen.</p><p>You gain access to the Focus Spells <em>@UUID[Compendium.the-longest-mile.dervish.VJlZs9QYTW559RCf]</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.the-longest-mile.dervish.8pR0eh4kACzxJilU]</em> which you can modify by spending additional Focus Points.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.the-longest-mile.journals.Q4XlMqXr82pmrJHI.JournalEntryPage.FsLFc9gAJuSsvy6h]{Dervish} archetype.</p>"
