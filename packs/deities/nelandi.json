She is the patron to all who seek justice long denied, and implores her followers to seek it at their own hands.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts: </strong>Take revenge, despise and never forgive those who have hurt you.</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema: </strong>Obstruct justice, continue to seek vengeance after fair punishment has been dealt, obstruct redemption.</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern: </strong>Vengeance, justice, law.</p>"
