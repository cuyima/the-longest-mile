A Blessing, Desna is notable for having once been imprisoned, but freed by Iocatha. For this reason, she is sometimes considered an Empyrean.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts: </strong>Seek out and challenge oppressors and tyrants, defend friends and the innocent, overcome despair and seize victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema: </strong>Suffer a bully's insults to you or another without retort, abandon a friend in need, harm the innocent through direct or inadvertent action.</p>"
